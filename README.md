# tw-airline-plugin
*a taskwarrior plugin for vim-airline*

Status: fantasy

This plugin is designed to show taskwarrior status info in a vim-airline status bar. The raw-airline-config is "lifted" from the most excellent vim-taskwarrior plugin, and using vim-taskwarrior with airline gives a nice, informative status bar, BUT that's only when viewing a vim-taskwarrior report.

The idea behind this pluging is a taskwarrior-status-bar available globally, ie. any time you are working in vim. 

The reason that the status is "fantasy" is that I have no real idea how to turn these configurations into an independent global plugin. 

So, if you are vim-savvy and taskwarrior enthused, please clone this repo and help me figure out how to make it a viable airline plugin, thanks!
